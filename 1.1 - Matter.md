## Components of an Atom
1. Nucleus - Positively Charged
2. Surrounding Electron Cloud - Negatively Charged

An Atom contains a [[Nucleus]] and [[Electrons]] in the electron cloud surrounding it. The [[Nucleus]] is made up of [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]], subatomic particles considered [[Baryons]].

[[Baryons]] are a group of particles made up of three [[Quarks]] and fall under the family of [[Hadrons]]. [[Hadrons]] also contain [[Mesons]], which are made up of [[Quarks]] and [[Anti-Quarks]].

Most of what we associate with matter (though only making up 4.9% of our Universe) is made of up particles called [[Leptons]] and [[Quarks]].

Both of these types of particles (called families) have three generations, almost identical copies of the first one, but much heavier. The ordinary matter around us today consists of Up Quarks, Down Quarks, Electrons, and the Lightest Neutrino.

To distinguish between these families, each generation has something called a flavor.

[[Quarks]] are used to create [[Hadrons]], larger particles that make up a lot of the day to day items that we know.

To be sensitive to the Strong force to keep particles together, particles must have the necessary charge called [[Color Charge]]. [[Quarks]] do have a [[Color Charge]], [[Leptons]] do not.

Charges are additive quantum numbers, so the total charge is the sum of that of its constituents.

## Conservation

**Total Baryon Number:** The Number of Baryons - The Number of Antibaryons = constant

**Lepton Number:** The Number of Leptons - The Number of Antileptons = constant

Charges of All Types are conserved

Flavor is Conserved
